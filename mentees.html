              <li><h1>He found art through appendicitis.  </h1> <p> He suffered an attack of appendicitis at age twenty. His mother brought him art supplies to help him pass time; it was then he discovered his love for art.</p>
              <li><h1> He was good friends with Pablo Picasso.</h1> <p> Matisse playfully referred to their friendship as a "boxing match": they were lifelong friends and major artistic rivals.</p>
              <li> <h1> He ran an art school for a couple years.</h1> <p> He ran the Academie Matisse in Paris from 1908 to 1911. He had his pupils draw copies of casts, sent them to the Lourve on weekends, and discussed color theory.</p>
              <li><h1>He is considered a founder of Favuism.</h1> <p>Fauvism reinterpreted color as a means of expression. Matisse famously once said "When I put down a green, it doesn‘t mean grass; and when I put down a blue, it doesn't mean the sky"</p>
              <li><h1>He studied law.</h1> <p> He passed his bar exam with distinction and was a practicing law clerk.</p>
              <li><h1>He had three cats.</h1> <p> Matisse's cats were named Minouche, Coussi, and La Puce and he fed them pieces of brioche every morning.</p>
