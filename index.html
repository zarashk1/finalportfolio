          <p>We plan to actively shrink the gender gap – one scientist, one doctor, one mathematician, and one engineer at a time.</p>

          <p1>Studies have shown that as girls enter high school, they begin to take fewer advanced STEM courses – despite that fact that boys and girls 
            statistically perform equally in such courses through 8th grade. This unfortunate pattern extends throughout universities and into higher education, 
            which has in turn fueled the overwhelming gender gap in STEM fields today. Our aim is to generate an early interest in STEM fields among middle school 
            girls through a 12-week interactive educational series which provides critical information about 10 STEM careers with substantial gender-gaps. We hope 
            to foster a lifelong community of driven young women and provide them with the opportunities to succeed within the world of STEM.

        <p>Henri Émile Benoît Matisse was a French artist, known for his use of color. Matisse is commonly regarded as one of the artists who helped to define revolutionary developments in art in the twentieth century. 
        The extensive and intense use of color in his works between 1900 and 1905 coined him as one of the Fauves, a group of French painters known as "wild beasts" for their strong colors and fierce brushstrokes.
